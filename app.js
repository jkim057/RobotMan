// break up string into arrays, create list items & div spots per string item // border on bottom of div to make the letters presentable.

// for each string of 5 or less letters, a certain amount of spacing and space 
// every 5 more letters will increase the space taken and REDUCE the borderspacing before and after the word.
// words to guess can be invisible, and and once guessed correctly will turn visible.
